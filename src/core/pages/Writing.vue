        What Iâ€™ve been up to lately:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>rewriting this website from static html document to a full single-page application</li>
        <li>working in a great co-working e-commerce startup environment called Jakmall here in Jakarta</li>
        <li>doing an online course on Laracasts to touch-up my skills</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm currently trying my hand in writing a blog here in <a :href="medium">Medium</a>. I will be very grateful if you can give me some feedback about my page since this is a new experience for me.
